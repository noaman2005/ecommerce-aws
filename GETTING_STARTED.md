# Getting Started with Paper & Ink

Welcome to Paper & Ink! This guide will help you get the application running on your local machine for development and testing.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
The app uses Next.js hot reload. Any changes you make will automatically refresh the browser.

### Real Data Integration
The app is fully integrated with AWS services. **AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions** handle all product and category operations with Cognito authorization. DynamoDB stores all data, and S3 is used for product image storage.

### State Management
- **Authentication**: Managed by Zustand (`lib/store/auth-store.ts`)
- **Cart**: Managed by Zustand (`lib/store/cart-store.ts`)
- **Persistence**: Cart and auth state persist in localStorage

### Styling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Custom design system in `app/globals.css`
- Framer Motion for animations

## Common Development Tasks

### Add a New Page

1. Create a new folder in `app/`
2. Add a `page.tsx` file
3. Export a default component

Example:
```tsx
// app/about/page.tsx
export default function AboutPage() {
  return <div>About Us</div>;
}
```

### Add a New Component

1. Create a file in `components/`
2. Export the component
3. Import where needed

Example:
```tsx
// components/ui/badge.tsx
export const Badge = ({ children }) => {
  return <span className="badge">{children}</span>;
};
```

### Add a New API Route

1. Create a file in `app/api/`
2. Export handler functions

Example:
```tsx
// app/api/hello/route.ts
export async function GET() {
  return Response.json({ message: 'Hello' });
}
```

## Testing Features

### Test Authentication Flow
1. Go to `/auth/signup`
2. Fill in the form (email, password, name)
3. Select "Customer" or "Host" role
4. Click "Create Account"
5. Note: Without AWS Cognito, this will show an error, but you can still explore the UI

### Test Shopping Flow
1. Browse products at `/products`
2. Click "Add to Cart" on any product
3. Go to `/cart`
4. Update quantities
5. Click "Proceed to Checkout"

### Test Admin Features
1. Manually set user role to "host" in the auth store (browser dev tools)
2. Refresh the page
3. Click "Dashboard" in navbar
4. Explore product management at `/admin/products`

## AWS Setup (Required)

The application requires AWS services to function:

1. **DynamoDB Tables**
   - `ecommerce-products` - Product catalog
   - `ecommerce-categories` - Product categories
   - `ecommerce-orders` - Order records
   - `ecommerce-order-items` - Order line items
   - `ecommerce-users` - User profiles

2. **S3 Bucket**
   - `ecommerce-product-images-420` - Product images with public read access

3. **Cognito User Pool**
   - For user authentication and authorization

4. **API Gateway (Optional)**
   - Lambda functions can be called directly via API Gateway
   - Currently, Next.js API routes handle most operations

See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed setup instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Kill process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000

# Or use a different port
npm run dev -- -p 3001
```

### Module Not Found
```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules .next
npm install
```

### TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Check for type errors
npm run type-check

# Or ignore and continue
# TypeScript errors won't prevent the dev server from running
```

### Styling Not Working
```bash
# Restart the dev server
# Tailwind CSS sometimes needs a restart to pick up new classes
```

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the Code**: Browse through the files to understand the structure
2. **Customize**: Modify colors, fonts, and layouts in `app/globals.css`
3. **Add Features**: Implement checkout, order history, or product reviews
4. **Set Up AWS**: Follow `DEPLOYMENT.md` to connect real backend services
5. **Deploy**: Push to Vercel for a live demo
